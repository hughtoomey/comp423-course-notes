This may take a few minutes while the image is downloaded and the requirements are installed.</p> <p>Once your dev container setup completes, close the current terminal tab (trash can), open a new terminal pane within VSCode, and try running go --version to see your dev container is running a recent version of Go without much effort! Use <code>go version</code> in your terminal to confirm that you have a semi recent version of Go installed (go version go1.20.14 linux/amd64 as of Jan/26/2025) !!! note title=\"Why Go?\"     Go is an open-source language developed by Google in 2007.
